# Software Engineering History and Fundamentals
Tomas Petricek - The Search for Fundamental Software Engineering

## What are the things about software engineering that are fundamental?
### Rooted in mathematics
Somethings will never change.
- Halting problem will always be true.
- Appending to linked list will always be O(n)

### Important Questions
- What is impossible to build?
- Can we guarantee cost or correctness?

This is not really a formal mathematics problem.

### Alternate approach to learning and teaching Software Engineering
- Find ideas throughout history that have a critical reflection of some idea or tool or method that's aware of the historical context.

### NATO 1968 Conference of Software Engineering
- Defined the phrase 'Software Engineering' and by extension what that means.
> Programming started to transition from a craft for a long-haired priest-hood to a real engineering discipline.

### Cultural Divide
- Business culture rooted in management
- Mathematics culture rooted in proofs

### Paradigm Change
In 1987 a paper was put forward arguing for software engineering to be:
- Product oriented
    - Software is seen as a product serving some fixed use-case
- Process oriented
    - Software emerges from the totality of interconnected processes of learning and communication in an evolving environment.

## Sources of Complexity
### Analog systems:
- Small change in input causes a small change in output.
- Operate on ranges.

### Digital Systems with Repeated Components
- Non-Linear
- We can test components in isolation.
- CPU units and most of modern hardware is built from repetition.

### Digital Systems without Repetition
- Non-linear and very hard to test.
- Any modern software system has a huge amount of states.

> Complex software can only be mastered if it is developed progressively, with the aid of extensive testing, and then operated more or less continually in a somewhat lenient and forgiving environment.

## Metaphors
Metaphors for software engineering taken from other disciplines.

Each metaphor has a misfit with software engineering.

### Engineering Metaphor
- Managerial response to crisis
- Focus on planning and control
