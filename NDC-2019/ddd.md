# Domain Driven Development
- Business vs Busyness
- Start with the purpose :)
  - First step to bridge the gap
  - If you can't align on purpose then you can't have autonomy

- What is the context? - [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](/Books/Pragmatic-Thinking-And-Learning/01-Introduction.md)
  - People get tunnel vision within their specialities

Offensive vs Defensive Development
- It's required to have balance between these.
> Sometimes people get stuck in the defensive side driven by fear

Defensive:
- Compliance
- Risk control
- Cost focus

Offensive:
- Growing the market
- New markets
- Revenue focus

### Organizing for activities, not outcomes
- Creates lots of friction
- Local optimizations can impact greater business outcomes
Typically the opposite of cross functional. Things flow down a long pipeline.

Cross functional teams can be threatened by management seeing _duplication_ and the drive to save money can wreck everything.

### A thought experiment
> Say every line of code in production is going to cost 1 dollar per year to maintain

__A vicious cycle__ -> Mythical Man Month
Adding people -> more code -> requires more people -> produces more code ...

### How should we work?
- Focus on __language__
- Creating language to share between developers and the greater business for each bounded context

Domain experts are extremely important!
> If your domain expert doesn't have time for you... then you should just leave...

Establishing common language is extremely important. Being able to communicate and engage with the experts in your domain is incredibly valuable.
- Evolving domain language is also an important refinement process.

Create DSL's to allow closer and tighter collaboration between domain experts and developers

### How to direct the energy?
If you are starting out a new initiative:
- If you have a new idea, the rest of the company will want to come and kill you (lol)
- New teams and ideas should have protection around them to protect them from the greater business
    - Primal, long ago - strange sounds meant a threat to your life
- If people are concerned or dissatisfied - a lot of energy gets wasted internally within the team

Communication style:
- I observe
- I think
- I feel
- I want

Fail forward:
- Failure is okay if the lessons you learned help you keep momentum and make decisions moving forward.

Put your ðŸ’µ in your competitive edge. What are your differentiating factors?
- It's important to reduce the bottlenecks in that area.

Common arguments against solving bottlenecks: (and choosing to spend energy elsewhere)
- Others are doing it
- It affects many people
