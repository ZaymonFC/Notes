# Repeating Themes

## Company Vision
- Actually broken down into clear goals
- What equals success for the company?
- What equals success for the team?
- What equals success for the individual?

## Culture
- People work best doing the things they love doing!
  - Not assigning work based off of a team members strengths and the things that they enjoy is both bad for culture and immediate productivity.
- Breakdown people's capabilities
    - Understanding team members capabilities assists in both assigning work, working out various team compositions and understanding where the team member fits in the organisation hierarchy.

*Have transparency within the process of Salary Views.*

**Team members shouldn't have to put their hands up and come to management / leadership:**
- 1:1's
- Career Progression
- Salary Reviews
- Process review and general feedback

**Team members don't feel wanted if they feel like it's on them to approach leadership about these things.**

Team members perform best when they feel empowered to do their best work.
