# Repeating Themes

## Company Vision
- Actually broken down into clear goals
- What equals success for the company?
- What equals success for the team?
- What equals success for the individual?

## Culture
- People work best doing the things they love doing
- Breakdown people's capabilities

People shouldn't have to put their hands up and come to management / leadership:
- 1:1's
- Salary Reviews
- Career Progression
- Process review and general feedback

People don't feel wanted if they feel like it's on them to approach leadership about these things.
