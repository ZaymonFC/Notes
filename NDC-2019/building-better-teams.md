### Advertising for Talent

## Culture
Breakdown peoples capabilities

Have transparency within the process of Salary Views.

People shouldn't have to put their hands up and come to management / leadership:
- 1:1's
- Career Progression
- Salary Reviews
- Process review and general feedback

People don't feel wanted if they feel like it's on them to approach leadership about these things.
