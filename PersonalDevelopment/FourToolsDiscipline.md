> The life of wisdom must be a life of contemplation combined with action

Most of us want to avoid problems:
- False starts
- Lack a consistent framework for self improvement
- They make us feel sad and alone

> Those things that hurt, instruct

## 1. Delay Gratification
Attempt to schedule the pain and pleasure of life in a way that enhances the pleasure. To do this you must meet and experience the pain first. Getting over the pain, not only imparts a sense of accomplishment, but provides contrast against the reward.

## 2. Accept Responsibility
Accepting responsibility can be emotionally uncomfortable.

It's a fallacy that we believe that the issue can be solved by simply saying _"That's not my problem"_. Other times we hope someone solved the problem for us.

Often saying "This is my problem and it's up to me" can give you the motivation to start tackling something.

Beware the extremes: the neurotic assumes too much responsibility. Assuming all the responsibilities around you will have the effect of every failure feeling like it's your burden - like you're at fault. Sometimes things are out of your control and it's important to strike the balance.

## 3. Dedication to Reality
Most of us have issues confronting reality because it does not _line up_ with how we want the world to work.

This lines up with the [The Map is Not The Territory](../Philosophy/TheMapIsNotTheTerritory.md) problem. When we've built our maps of systems and the world up over years, we tend to ignore new information that challenges our views. Sometimes we even become defensive. Rather than mentally changing our map often we seek to destroy the new reality and those who subscribe to it.

Be open to challenge. Not just from others, but be open to inspecting and challenging your own beliefs.

## 4. Balance
Balance is the discipline that gives us flexibility.

__Balancing is a discipline because the act of giving something up is painful.__
