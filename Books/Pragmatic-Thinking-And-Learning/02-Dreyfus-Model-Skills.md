> Are we going to delve into any theory along this journey of tuning our minds?

There are two kinds of theories we are interested in: __event theories__ and __construct theories__. Event theories are measurable, provable, objective and quantifiable.

> Okay

Construct theories are intangible abstractions. It doesn't make any sense to prove them because being able to prove them is not their worth. I can prove all sorts of things about your brain, but I can't __prove__ you have a *mind*.

> So where do we start?

We're going to start with the Dreyfus model. But first we are going to talk about something interesting about experts.

> What's that Adam?

Experts often can't explain why they chose do to things a certain way to novices. We'll get into why soon. Experts tend to have so much of their experience locked within preconscious actions and awareness. If you say to an expert chef to cook until done, he'll know what that means for the cut of meat you just gave him, adjusting for the humidity, when the meat was bought, which cut it is and so on. Often experts can't articulate these subtle calculations. They just appear in aggregate.

> So many considerations, how are they able to consider all that?

First we need to look at the Dreyfus model and the 5 stages of skill development, then I think you will see.
