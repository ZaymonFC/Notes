## The Setup and Introductions
Some of the most valuable skills a craftsman can have in this day and age are:
- Learning and Thinking
- Communication

> Andy, What is pragmatism?

Pragmatism at it's essence, is to do what works for you. Throughout this book we'll be tackling things both from a point of research and things that can't objectively be measured. People are different. Different things resonate and work for different people.

> Okay, so leading into the first chapter, what's Wetware?

Wetware is where you regard human brains and processes to being analogous to computer systems. Mapping processing and interactions from the programatic world back onto our biology.

> So that leads the implication that no one system is interconnected?

Everything is part of a system or greater context. Sometimes it's hard to see. That's why in our brains and in real life. Small things can often have very large consequences. Truly a hallmark of chaotic, non-linear systems.

> Why would it be beneficial to think like that?

System thinking: taking a systems view of the world. Everything is interconnected. Take social systems, nature, business hierarchies, your innermost thoughts. Modeling everything as discreet lends to our model of reality and the world around us to be anemic. Things that should abstractly be the same: talking aloud, thinking to yourself, writing something down are very different and have profound consequences.

Things can be visualised as systems, graphs, connections of vertices and edges. Small changes in places can have ramifications across surprisingly subtle edges. You can never be an observer of such a system. Your mere presence connects you to points all around you.

> Okay so it seems like thinking in systems is a way to reduce our assumptions and consider the consequences of our actions. Is there a name for that process?

All these things, the relationships around you are the context.
