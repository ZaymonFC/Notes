# Notes on Catamorphisms

> A catamorphism isa general abstraction that enables you to handle multiple values - in order to reduce them to a single value.

Catamorphism is the morphism of reducing many values to a single value. This is commonly called `reduce`, `collect`, `aggregate` and `accumulate`.
