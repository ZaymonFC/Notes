## The Map is Not the Territory

The map of reality is **not** reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. Maps are reductions of what they represent. Maps are snapshots in time.


From [A Non-Aristotelian System and its Necessity for Rigor in Mathematics and Physics](http://esgs.free.fr/uk/art/sands-sup3.pdf)

- A. A map may have a structure similar or dissimilar to the structure of the territory.
- B. Two similar structures have similar ‘logical’ characteristics. Thus, if in a correct map, Dresden is given as between Paris and Warsaw, a similar relation is found in the actual territory.
- C. A map is not the actual territory.
- D. An ideal map would contain the map of the map, the map of the map of the map, etc., endlessly… We may call this characteristic self-reflexiveness.

Maps are necessary. It's impossible to model reality in infinite detail. There must be some abstraction which hides implementation.

The tendency to map everything is problematic in our effort to simplify reality. When we see a powerful model work well, we tend to over-apply it, using it in non-analogous situations. We have trouble delimiting its usefulness, which causes errors.
